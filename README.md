# PHPTemplate PatternEngine for Pattern Lab

The PHPTemplate PatternEngine allows you to use [PHPTemplate](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/theming) as the template language for Pattern Lab PHP. Once the PatternEngine is installed you can use PHPTemplate-based StarterKits and StyleguideKits.


## Installation

The PHPTemplate PatternEngine comes pre-installed with the [Pattern Lab Edition for PHPTemplate](https://github.com/aleksip/edition-php-tpl). Please start there for all your PHPTemplate needs.


### Composer

Pattern Lab PHP uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage project dependencies with Pattern Lab Editions. To add the PHPTemplate PatternEngine to the dependencies list for your Edition you can type the following in the command line at the base of your project:

    composer require aleksip/patternengine-tpl
